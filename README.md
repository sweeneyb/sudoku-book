## What
A playground where I'm exploring book publishing and automation.  I've always been curious about wrapping a series of blog posts up into a book auto-magically.  In the meantime, I'm going to generate a bunch of sukodu puzzles (thanks https://github.com/RutledgePaulV/sudoku-generator) and see if I can publish those.  Low payoff, but very low upfront costs with on-demand publishing.

## How
After generating puzzles from https://github.com/RutledgePaulV/sudoku-generator, I'm futzing with the layout.  I'm thinking hints will be QR codes that link to either a FaaS or a bunch of pre-generated things.  I've got very little experience building PDFs, so that was part of the learning.  Python has some decent tools, but I bet this will be easier to use LaTeX and import a set generated things.  Good reason to start learning LaTeX.
